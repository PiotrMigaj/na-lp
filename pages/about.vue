            <p class="mb-6 font-light leading-relaxed">
              With over a decade of experience in the fashion photography industry, I've had the privilege of working
              with some of the most prestigious brands and publications around the world.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6 font-light leading-relaxed">
              My journey began at the Royal Academy of Arts, where I developed a strong foundation in classical
              photography techniques. After graduating, I apprenticed with legendary photographers in Paris and Milan,
              where I refined my skills and developed my distinctive visual language.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6 font-light leading-relaxed">
              What sets my work apart is the emphasis on creating a narrative that goes beyond just showcasing garments.
              Each photo tells a story, evokes an emotion, and captures a moment that feels both timeless and
              contemporary.
            </p>
            <p class="font-light leading-relaxed">
              When I'm not behind the camera, you can find me traveling the world in search of new inspiration,
              attending art exhibitions, or mentoring emerging photographers who share my passion for visual
              storytelling.

    <!-- Philosophy -->
    <section class="py-24 bg-accent">

          <div>
            <SectionHeader title="My Philosophy" />
            <p class="mb-6 font-light leading-relaxed">
              I believe that great fashion photography exists at the intersection of technical precision and artistic
              intuition. My approach combines meticulous attention to detail with an openness to the unexpected moments
              that often create the most compelling images.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6 font-light leading-relaxed">
              For me, photography is not just about documenting clothesâ€”it's about creating a mood, a feeling, and a
              world that viewers want to step into. It's about finding beauty in both the extraordinary and the
              everyday, and using light, composition, and narrative to create images that resonate.
            </p>
            <p class="font-light leading-relaxed">
              I value collaboration above all else. My best work happens when there's a true partnership with clients,
              models, stylists, and other creatives. When we all bring our unique perspectives to the table, magic
              happens.
